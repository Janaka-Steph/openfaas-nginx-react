= ReactJS SPA on OpenFaaS

Based on OpenFaaS Dockerfile template, serving the app with Nginx:
https://github.com/alexellis/static-site-template


== Running the prod locally

.In one tab
 kubectl port-forward svc/gateway -n openfaas 8080:8080

.In a other tab
 faas up


== Developing with Okteto

.Build a dev image with NodeJS and Nginx into the local Docker library
 DEV=dev faas build

.Push that image to a remote container registry
 DEV=dev faas push

 cd function

.Sync local source code with remote
 okteto up

=== Inside Okteto console

.Run OpenFaaS watchdog in the background
 fwatchdog &

.Press Enter

.Install dependencies
 cd function

 npm install

.Run build on file change
 npm run watch


== Shortcomings

=== No Hot Reloading

For now, create-react-app doesn't give to possibility to write webpack-dev-server output to disk (see https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6144[this thread]).
We are forced to use an external tool. This project uses https://github.com/Nargonath/cra-build-watch[cra-build-watch].
It works fine but doesn't allow for hot reloading.

=== Service Worker

The service worker may cause issues. If you activate it, make sure to develop the app in incognito window on Chrome or similar.
